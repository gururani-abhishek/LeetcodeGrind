This question was to check our pattern checking abilities, if pattern = "IIII" then the minimum number which can be formed in correspondence to this pattern would be : 12345,
if the pattern would have been : IIDI, then : 12435, if the pattern would have been, IDIDI
132546.
123456789
IIIDIDDD -> 123549876
123456789
IIIDIDID -> 123547698
IIDDDDID -> 127654398
DDDIDDID -> 432176598
